# Astound
Astound is a Vanilla+ modpack focused on subtly upgrading the game. Combining big and small content mods with optimization and quality of life tweaks, Astound reimagines the Minecraft experience from the ground up, letting you enjoy aspects of the game you may have otherwise overlooked.
## Features
- **Carefully curated:** Every mod, big or small, has been assesed and tweaked in order to bring a cohesive experience and improve compatibility.
- **For the community:** Astound aims to give the spotlight to new and lesser known mods, all available on the Modrinth ecosystem.
- **(Re)balanced content:** The game is no longer a straight jog to nab an Elytra: if you want to make it to The End, you'll have to explore the world, defeating powerful enemies and building roads and railways along the way.
- **Fascinating world:** With over 30 new biomes to explore in all three dimensions, all upgraded and tuned to fit with each other in terms of detail and quality, you'll witness no shortage of wonderful sights.
- **Optimal performance:** Mods such as Sodium, Lithium and Noisium ensure that the experience remains smooth and stable.
